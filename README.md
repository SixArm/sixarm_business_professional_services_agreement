### A. Services

The Provider shall furnish the following services:

A.1. Act as a provider to the Organization, to perform {SUMMARY OF SERVICES}, as required and authorized by the Organization.

Each Written Authorization will state the specific services to be performed, the schedule for their completion, and the method of compensation in accordance with paragraph IV. 

A2. Furnish drawings, documents, reports, surveys, renderings, exhibits, models, prints, and photographs, and other materials as required and as authorized by the Organization.

B.2. Provider acknowledges that Organization have deferred negotiations on a fee for Basic Services and rate schedule for Additional Services described in the EDPA; and 

B.3. Provider has read and understood the EDPA in Exhibits and agrees to all of its terms and provisions. 


### C. Design

If Organization requires the Provider's services as Design Professional for the Project, Provider agrees to the following:

C.1. Provider will not request any modifications to those terms and provisions to the EDPA and will execute the EDPA in the form in the Exhibits; and 

C.2. Provider will negotiate in good faith both a fee to perform the Basic Services and a rate schedule to perform Additional Services based on its then current rate structure consistent with its normal practice and consistent with Organization guidelines for fees and rates for similar projects.

### C. Organization-initiated termination

1. If the Organization determines that the Provider has failed to perform in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Organization may terminate all or part of the Agreement for cause. This termination shall become effective if the Provider does not cure its failure to perform within 10 days (or more, if authorized in writing by the Organization) after receipt of a notice of intention to terminate from the Organization specifying the failure in performance. If a termination for cause does occur, the Organization shall have the right to withhold monies otherwise payable to the Provider until the services under this Agreement are completed. If the Organization incurs additional costs, expenses, or other damages due to the failure of the Provider to properly perform pursuant to the Agreement, these costs, expenses, or other damages shall be deducted from the amounts withheld. Should the amounts withheld exceed the amounts deducted, the balance will be paid to the Provider upon completion of the services to be provided under this Agreement. If the costs, expenses, or other damages incurred by the Organization exceed the amounts withheld, the Provider shall be liable to the Organization for the difference.

2. Organization may terminate this Agreement for convenience at any time upon written notice to Provider, in which case Organization will pay Provider for all services performed and all expenses incurred under this Agreement up to and including the effective date of termination less any costs, expenses or other damages due to the failure of the Provider to properly perform pursuant to the Agreement.

Provider may terminate this Agreement for cause if the Organization fails to cure a material default in performance within a period of 30 days, or such longer period as the Provider may allow, after receipt from the Provider of a written termination notice specifying the default in performance.

When Provider or subproviders employ workers in any apprenticeship craft or trade for the Covered Services hereunder, Provider or subproviders shall apply to the joint apprenticeship committee, which administers the apprenticeship standards of the craft or trade in the locality, if any, listed in the written authorization for the performance of construction, alteration, demolition or repair work as defined in Section 1720 of the State of California Labor Code, for a certificate approving Provider or subproviders under the apprenticeship standards for the employment and training of apprentices in the locality so identified. The committee will issue a certificate fixing the number of apprentices or the ratio of apprentices to journeypersons who shall be employed in the craft or trade on the Covered Services hereunder. The ratio will not exceed that stipulated in the apprenticeship standards under which the joint apprenticeship committee operates; but in no case shall the ratio be less than 1 hour of apprentice work for every 5 hours of journeyperson work, except as permitted by law. Provider or subproviders shall, upon the issuance of the approval certificate in each such craft or trade, employ the number of apprentices or the ratio of apprentices to journeypersons fixed in the certificate issued by the joint apprenticeship committee or present an exemption certificate issued by the Division of Apprenticeship Standards.

4. “Apprenticeship craft or trade”, as used in this Paragraph, shall mean a craft or trade determined as an apprenticeship occupation in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Apprenticeship Council.

5. If Provider or subproviders employ journeypersons or apprentices in any apprenticeship craft or trade in the locality, if any, listed in the written authorization for the performance of construction, alteration, demolition or repair work as defined in Section 1720 of the State of California Labor Code, and there exists a fund for assisting to allay the cost of the apprenticeship program in the trade or craft, to which fund or funds other Providers in the locality so identified are contributing, Provider and subproviders or subproviders shall contribute to the fund or funds in each craft or trade in which they employ journeypersons or apprentices on the Covered Services hereunder in the same amount or upon the same basis and in the same manner done by the other Providers. Provider may include the amount of such contributions in computing its compensation under the Agreement; but if Provider fails to do so, it shall not be entitled to any additional compensation therefore from Organization.

6. In the event Provider willfully fails to comply with this Paragraph VI.D, it will be considered in violation of the requirements of the Agreement.

7. Nothing contained herein shall be considered or interpreted as prohibiting or preventing the hiring by Provider or subproviders of journeyperson trainees who may receive on-the-job training to enable them to achieve journeyperson status in any craft or trade under standards other than those set forth for apprentices.


### E. Work day
 
1. Provider shall not permit any worker providing Covered Services to labor more than 8 hours during any 1 day or more than 40 hours during any 1 calendar week, except as permitted by law and in such cases only upon such conditions as are provided by law. Provider shall forfeit to Organization, as a penalty, $25 for each worker employed in the execution of this Agreement by Provider, or any subproviders or subprovider, for each day during which such worker is required or permitted to work providing Covered Services more than 8 hours in any 1 day and 40 hours in any 1 calendar week in violation of the terms of this Paragraph or in violation of the provisions of any law of the State of California. Such forfeiture amounts may be deducted from the compensation otherwise due under this Agreement. Provider and each subprovider or subprovider shall keep, or cause to be kept, an accurate record showing the actual hours worked each day and each calendar week by each worker employed under this Agreement, which record shall be kept open at all reasonable hours to the inspection of Organization, its officers and agents, and to the inspection of the appropriate enforcement agency of the State of California.


### F. PATIENT HEALTH INFORMATION
 
1. Provider acknowledges that its employees, agents, subproviders, providers and others acting on its behalf may come into contact with Patient Health Information ("PHI") while performing work at the Project Site. This contact is most likely rare and brief (e.g. walking through a clinic where patient files may be visible, overhearing conversations between physicians while working or touring a hospital, noticing a relative or acquaintance receiving treatment in a Organization facility, etc.). Provider shall immediately notify Organization Representative of any such contact. Any and all forms of PHI should not be examined closer, copied, photographed, recorded in any manner, distributed or shared. Provider will adopt procedures to ensure that its employees, agents and subproviders refrain from such activity. If Provider, its employees, agents or subproviders do further examine, copy, photograph, record in any manner, distribute or share this information, Provider will report such actions immediately to the Organization Representative. Provider will immediately take all steps necessary to stop any such actions and will ensure that no further violations of this contractual responsibility will occur. Provider will report to Organization Representative within five (5) days after Provider gives Organization Representative notice of the event/action of the steps taken to prevent future occurrences.
